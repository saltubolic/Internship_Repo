Hey Smit, 
Welcome to your Saltubolic Experience!!! We're excited to have you onboard. 
Here is basically all of the documentation you should know for the API:
1. https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/api/models/worksheet.html
2. https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/api/models/cell.html
3. https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#for-bots-using-service-account
4. https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts

Here is the high-level layout. Google Cloud Platform enables us to use their applications via service account, which is the goofy email
that your dummy program is shared with. In order for that service account to be authenized, we have a credential file
"tes_json"(sorry if its a little complicated, feel free to change its name). You will use its absolute path when working in drive, 
or when its not in your current working directory. 

Gspread uses Google Sheets API on the back-end, henceforth it inherits its RESTful interface. Please feel free to explore how you can optimize
the time/space complexity of product features by intertwining the two. 

The MRO for Gspread is Spreadsheet, Worksheet, Cell in descending order. They all have special methods that you can use for parsing/seralizing data 
from/in Google Sheets. 


The project on Google Cloud Platform is shared with your email, so you can view Request Traffic, Errors and Median Latency. Be careful!!
There is a catch!!! The API's have rate limitations...Make sure to review those and test them!!!

I(Michael) have linked a notebook with necessary code to begin testing...
This is a dummy testing key and a program, so feel free to let your creativity run wild.
